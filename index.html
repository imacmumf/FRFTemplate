          FirstRule Financial is a boutique professional services firm with specialized fraud, embezzlement and other financial crime subject matter expertise. We provide independent, unbiased advice and service, free from conflicts of interest.
          Where your money, litigation or investigations are involved, independence is an absolute must or you won’t get the full benefit of the expertise you are paying for.<br>
          When you hire us, you can count on effectiveness and efficiency.<br> <br>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>We use a smaller team with a focused approach which means less disruption to you.</li>
            <li>As a boutique firm, we work on fewer engagements at any given time, making you our priority.</li>
            <li>Our background and expertise means you can take comfort in knowing that whatever the findings, the issue has been thoroughly examined. </li>
          </ul>
          One of the other benefits of being an independent boutique is that we have flexibility to negotiate fees and terms with our clients that are acceptable to both parties. In forensic accounting, where the big accounting and consulting firms
          are charging up to $1,000 an hour, the adage that you only get what you pay for isn’t true. Even though our rates are very reasonable, our expertise is second to none.

          We invite you to give us a call and we’ll be happy to discuss how we can help resolve your concerns. <br> <br>

              The world of personal finance has become very risky. It has been reported that investors in the U.S. lose more than $40 billion annually to fraud. Everyone is familiar with stories of individuals who were vistimized by fraud over the
              past few years; thousands fell victim to Bernie Madoff and Allan Stanford in high profile Ponzi schemes. But thousands more have been victimized by con-artists, cybercrime, trusted advisers and business associates. You don’t hear about
              most fraud because it isn’t reported. But the numbers are significant and are not diminishing. And fraud isn’t the only risk to your wealth.

              <h3>Wealth-Check for Individuals and Families</h3>
              If you don’t know the personal financial risks you face, you don’t know if you are taking prudent steps to mitigate those risks. Wealth-Check is our methodology for identifying and assessing the significance of the risks you face. At
              the same time, we search for signs of fraud in your current investments and financial management. Using our observations, we provide education about identified risks, their potential consequences and prudent steps you can take to
              minimize your chances of a major loss. You can use this information as a baseline for monitoring your risks and finances going forward; or if you don’t have the time or desire to do it yourself, we can monitor your financial affairs on
              an ongoing basis.<br><br>

              You may think that your financial advisory firm or financial manager is looking out for these risks. But their decisions, business processes or people may actually be the source of the risk, whether through incompetence, mismanagement
              or intentional acts. Fundamentally, in any situation, it isn’t wise to have the people handling your money audit their own decisions, operations and controls.<br><br>

              ​

              FirstRule’s independence means that we can assess the risks in your financial affairs without being influenced by a real, or potential, conflict with your interests. We aren’t interested in doing your financial management or managing
              your investments. We’re just interested in assisting you to minimize the risks of suffering a major loss.<br><br>

    <h3>First Rule Financial</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      <p>FirstRule Financial was founded in 2002 as Luminescent Inc. and was rebranded as FirstRule Financial in 2015.

        We have been providing risk consulting and forensic accounting services to individuals and families, trusts, foundations, nonprofit organizations, family businesses and law firms for over 30 years.

        Our expertise in these areas has been built on hundreds of cases involving fraud and embezzlement, other financial crimes, regulatory non-compliance, business and family disputes or litigation. That experience has provided us with direct
        knowledge of how people carry out their schemes, how they conceal them, where the risks are, how to detect them, and what processes and controls can prevent them. <br><br>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemumfordfirstrulefinancial/">Michael (Mike) Mumford CPA (Inactive), CFF, CPA Can, CFE</a>
        <br><br>

        Mike Mumford began his forensic accounting career in Toronto with a boutique practice that, at the time, was the sole provider of forensic accounting services to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other law enforcement agencies on complex
        white-collar crime investigations. It was through these criminal investigations that Mike learned what was needed to meet the standard of proof for criminal fraud, how to conduct effective interviews of witnesses and subjects, and how to
        simplify and report complex financial transactions and concepts. Mike’s experience working with law enforcement on criminal cases included financial institution frauds, a Ponzi scheme, money laundering, financial motive, and proceeds of crime
        asset tracing. Michael also was frequently retained by financial regulators to perform fraud and conflict of interest investigations at financial institutions and insurance companies.

        In 1994 Michael joined Arthur Andersen and became Partner-in-Charge of the Business Fraud Risk Services practice for Canada. In 1997 he moved to the U.S. to start and lead Deloitte’s Minneapolis Forensic and Investigative Services practice.
        In 2002 Michael started his current company, Luminescent Inc., which now operates as FirstRule Financial Inc., and provides investigative and forensic accounting, and risk consulting. <br><br>
        During his career Mike has led hundreds of complex forensic accounting engagements involving such matters as fraud, embezzlement, regulatory issues, insurance claims, investment fraud, shareholder disputes and commercial litigation. In
        addition, Mike has assisted numerous organizations and individuals to assess and mitigate embezzlement, fraud and other risks.

        <br><br>
        Mike is also the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Avoidable-Losses-Professional-Entertainers-Wondering-ebook/dp/B07G6PDV5J">Avoidable Losses: A Guide to Keeping What You’ve Earned, at Amazon</a>. You can read the review by Walter

        <h2>"Could Your Financial Advisors Be Cheating You?".</h2>
        <p>In my 30 years as a forensic accountant I have seen far too many people lose much or all of the money they were relying on to fund their future plans, their retirement, their succeeding generations or their legacy. This is a tragedy that
          shouldn't happen to anyone.<br><br>

          While there are many ways you can lose what you have, one of the factors in many significant losses is over-reliance on a financial or investment advisor, regardless of what title they use.<br><br>

          If you rely on an advisor for advice or management of your finances and/or investments, trust is not enough to protect you. These assessments will help you understand more about your risks of significant loss as a result of your reliance on
          and trust in your financial advisor(s). The first assessment is about the person who manages or advises you on your investments. The second is about the person/firm involved in managing your financial affairs including setting up or doing
          your banking, collecting money you earn, paying your bills, making purchases, moving money, arranging loans, etc. If the same person provides both investment advice and financial management, you should complete both assessments.</p>
